=====[GitHub page for "Show Tracker" (name massive wip)]=====

The goal of this application is to allow a user to create an account, where they
can then start to track media (shows/movies/etc.) that they are watching. The user
should in the end be able to log into their account, see the media they are tracking,
view their profile, add friends (tentatively), and view others profiles. 


Currently, there is:

	- A log-in page, not currently doing anything as there is no database
	- An account creation page, also not currently doing anything as no db
	- A "landing page/ home page" that is majorly empty
	- A "profile" page that once again doesn't currently do much


In the coming future: 

	- Add db functionality so user can actually create an account
	- Create user profile tie-in with db and accessable
	- Figure out how to modify navbar to change when a user is logged in 
	- UI updates/changes to make application prettier
	- WILL CHANGE .html FILES TO USE A HEADER/FOOTER FILE INSTEAD (just not done currently)
