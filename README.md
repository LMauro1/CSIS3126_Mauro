=====[GitHub page for "Indagatrix"]=====

The goal of this application is to allow a user to create an account, where they
can then start to track media (shows/movies/etc.) that they are watching. The user
should in the end be able to log into their account, see the media they are tracking,
view their profile, add friends (tentatively), and view others profiles. 


Link to the current application: https://lmauro1.github.io/CSIS3126_Mauro (currently not working I believe)

Currently, there is:

	- A login and registration page (entirely functional, user can create an account, log in, and view their profile).
	- A "landing page/ home page" that displays a list of popular movies and shows sourced from the TMDB API (https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api),
	  as well as allows the user to search the TMDB database for shows and movies. 
	- A "view details" button on each movie/show that links to a page with more indepth information (rating, if its airing, how many seasons
	  it has, reviews, etc.) 
	- A "top movies" page that shows the 20 highest movies on TMDB
	- A "top shows" page that shows the 20 highest rated shows on TMDB
	- A "help?" tab that will be implemented differently in the future but provides an overview of some things about the website (will be
	  further fleshed out in later pushes). 
	- A "Users" tab that (hopefully) will be able to allow someone to look through other users on site. Currently displays users, but 
	  doesn't link to them.

More to come in the coming few days.
