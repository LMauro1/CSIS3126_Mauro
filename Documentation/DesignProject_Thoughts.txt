Design Project project:

"Social Media" application (Web app) that allows the user to log in, track shows that they are watching/want to watch/have watched, ect. 
 
Possibly (probably) expand to encompass more than just shows, i.e games, music, ect.(once the base movies gets done expanding it shouldnt
be too hard) 

User will be able to share their tracked list with other people, see other people who also watch the same shows. 

Tagen said could expand to encompass collabrative show tracking (so I guess maybe inviting someone to view how far you are in a show?)
he also said "even a little 'following what your friends are watching' has value.".

Adding rating shows probably wouldnt be difficult.

Could show top rated shows and sort them.

I had an idea to expand this by maybe allowing people to download these things (shows/games/music/etc)but I think collecting all of that 
and hosting it would
1. be difficult
2. be illegal
